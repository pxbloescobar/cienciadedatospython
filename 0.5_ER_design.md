## Simple Flight Crew Assignment

a) An airplane (Tail-#) is assigned to several flights (Flight-#). A flight is assigned to only one airplane.

b) A pilot (SocialSec-ID) can perform several flights. A flight is performed by several (normally at least two) pilots.

### Soluciones

La cardinalidad de la relación de **pilot** a **flight** tiene la particularidad de que no solo es de **1 a N**, sino de **exactamente 2**, es decir, hay un tope superior en esta cardinalidad. Eso puede resolverse de 2 formas:

1) O dejamos que el área de _database adminstration_ nos haga el favor de meter código SQL para limitar esta cardinalidad superior...

2) ... o damos mayor contexto a la relación y especificamos claramente que la relación es de 2 instancias, lo cual logramos con 2 relaciones de **1 a N** de **flight** a la misma tabla de **pilot**.

Con la salvedad de que, gracias al "contexto extra", podemos suponer que, al momento de registrar un vuelo, podemos hacerlo **sin avión** y **sin piloto**, y registrarlos después, por lo que las relaciones pueden ser marcadas como **opcionales**.

## Cost Centers & Capacities

a) Cost centres (CC-#) issue activities (Act-#), whereby a cost centre can also issue several activities; each activity can be issued by several cost centres.

b) The employees (Soc-#) of a group are combined to work centres (Wrk-#), with employees being uniquely assigned to them. Each work centre can deliver one or more activities of a cost centre.

c) The enterprise defines specific capacity types (Cap-ID). Each work centre is assigned to one or more capacity types.

d) The enterprise also defines certain scheduling variants (SV-ID), which are assigned to work centres. A work centre can be scheduled only in one way.

## Airport & Flight Control

a) A flight (Flight-#) consists of one or more flight legs (Flight-Leg-ID), flight legs belong to one flight. Flight legs start at one airport (Code) and end at another airport.

b) Flight legs are parts of a daily flight leg combination (DFLeg-ID). A daily flight leg combination is assigned to one aircraft type (Type ID) and an aircraft type is assigned to one daily flight leg combination.

c) An aircraft type can land at several airports.

## Production Plan Control

a) Parts (Part-#) are connected by a hierarchical bill of materials structures.

b) On a technical level there are individual technical procedures (TP-#), which can be used as a production step in routings (RO-#). A routing consists of several technical procedures; a technical procedure can be used in several routings.

c) A production step physically produces one or more items of the bill of materials structure. For complex parts, items of the bill of materials structure need to be produced in several production steps.

d) The number of resources (Rec-#) is combined into groups of resources (GOR-#) (a resource can be assigned only to one group of resources).

e) Each group of resources has several employees (SI-ID) and tools (T-#). Tools are definitely assigned to a group of resources. Employees, however, can be assigned to several groups of resources.

f) A production step can use one or more resources. Resources are required in several production steps.

## Credit Limit Check

a) Credit limit check parameter (ChkCr-ID) determines which type of credit check (no check, simple check,...) is performed for each of the sales document types (SaTy-ID). A sales document type can only be assigned to one ChkCr-ID.

b) There are credit groups (CGr-#) for e.g. sales order, delivery and goods issue. A credit group can be assigned to several sales document types, whereas a sales document type can only be assigned to one credit group.

c) Many sales document types can be assigned to the same billing type (BTy-#) and the same delivery type (DelTy-#). Sales document types are uniquely assigned to a billing type and a delivery type.

d) The system can automatically propose a block reason (Block-#) for sales documents that must be checked before billing. A block can be assigned to several sales document types, whereas a sales document type is assigned to one block reason only.

## Client database

a) Customers (Cust-#) are categorized in account groups: A customer belongs to one account group (AGroup-#) only, while an account group may contain several customers.

b) Customers may belong to several sales organisations (SalesOrg-#). Each sales organisation is linked to one or more distribution channels (DC-#). Each distribution channel is assigned to one or more divisions (Div-#).

c) Each customer has at least one address,

d) and may operate with one or more incoterms.

## Stock Management

a) Customers (Cust-#) place orders in a certain interval (I-ID, e.g. industrial calendar week). Each of these orders can consist of several materials (Mat-#) as line items.

b) A plant (P-#) has several storage locations (SL-ID); the latter are uniquely assigned to one plant.

c) Materials can be stored in several storage locations (storage location stock).

d) The demand created by a certain line item can be met by several stocks of that material in various storage locations.

## Customization of a Production Order

a) On creation of a production order the combination of order type (OTy-#) and plant (Pl-#) needs to be determined. There are several order types and plants, whereby each order type can be assigned to any plant.

b) For material availability checks for production, each checking rule can be assigned to several checking groups (ChG-#) and each checking group (e.g. "Daily Requirements") can be assigned to several checking rules (ChR-#). Production orders are uniquely assigned to one checking rule. However checking rules can comprise many more than one production order.

c) Materials (Mat-#) are related to checking groups, whereby each material is associated with one checking group only. The latter can be assigned to several materials.

d) Unique scheduling parameters (SchP-#) are assigned to the plant/order type combination. However, different combinations can use the same scheduling parameters.

e) The pre-costing of production orders is done using costing variants (CV-#). Each plant/order type combination has only one costing variant.

f) A valuation variant (VV-#) determines how direct costs and OH surcharges are evaluated. It is linked to only one costing variant, whereby the costing variant can be assigned to one or more valuation variants.

g) A valuation variant is uniquely assigned to a material valuation (MV-#) and a capacity valuation (Cva-#). These evaluations may be used in several valuation variants.

h) A valuation variant is uniquely assigned to a costing sheet (CS-#)

## Car Rental System

a) A car rental service rents (rental agreement) its cars (Car-ID) to the customers (Cust-ID), who can be private customers or business clients.

b) Each customer has a driver's licence (DL-#) with one or more categories (Cat-ID). These categories allow the person to drive certain vehicle classes (VC-ID).

c) Special corporate bonus programs (CBP-#) exist for business clients. These business clients can be assigned to one of these programs.

d) Each car belongs to one vehicle class, needs a certain fuel (Fuel-#) and belongs to a specific price class (PC-#).

e) These cars have different features (Feat-ID) (e.g. ESP, ABS ...).

f) The vehicle is available for rentals for a specified time period (TP-ID). There are fixed prices (Price-#) for several periods (e.g. price per day, price per week).

g) The rental agreement contains several options (e.g. type of insurance, chauffeur etc.) The client can choose from these options (OPT-#). The prices of the different options may change, depending on the rental period (TP-ID).

h) Each car has a damage document (DD-ID). In this document, the location (L-#) and the type (T-#) of damage has to be noted. The rental agreement includes the damage document. The car rental firm will have an agreement with several specialized garages (G#) to repair any damages noted in the damage document.

## ER

a) Patients (Ins-#) access with traumata Emergency Rooms (Depart-#), within a certain Period (Period-#).

b) An Emergency room can consist of more than one Surgery (Sur-#), more than one Internal (Int-#) but only of one Radiology (Rad-#). All three are uniquely assigned to one Emergency Room.

c) Surgery has a Surgeon (Surgeon-#), who is responsible for one or more Surgeries. One or more Surgeons can examine one ore more traumata of the patients in the emergency room.

d) Internal has an Internist (Internist-#), who is responsible for one or more Internals. One or more Internists can consult in one or more examinations.
